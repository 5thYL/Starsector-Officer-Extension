# Officer Extension

A Starsector mod that offers the ability to suspend and demote officers.

## Suspend officers

- Suspend officers in your fleet for an upfront fee equal to four times their monthly salary.
- Suspended officers cannot be assigned to any ship and do not count against your normal officer limit. However, they must still be paid 25% of their standard salary.
- Suspended officers can be reinstated at any time for no cost, as long as reinstatement would not cause you to exceed your officer limit.
- Does not apply to mercenaries or AI cores.

## Demote officers

- Demote officers by selecting skills for them to forget. Forgetting skills causes an officer to lose levels equal to the number of skills forgotten.
- Demoting an officer requires a story point and grants 100% bonus experience.
- Officers cannot be demoted below level 1. 
- Does not apply to mercenaries or AI cores.

## Miscellaneous QoL

- Sorts officer payroll in the income tab by pay, followed by officer name for officers with equal pay. This applies to suspended officers as well.
- Upon interacting with another fleet, displays that fleet's commander's combat skills, including fleet-wide skills.

## Additional notes

- Safe to add to or remove from an existing save file.
